            </h2>   
            <div class="content-text">
             <p>My Name is Ferronique May. I
                matriculated in 2016. In 2017, I 
                studied a bachelor of Arts in Human 
                Resource and Psychology. After
                successfully completing my first
                year, I was forced to postpone
                my studies and work full time.
                The bookstore I was working on a 
                part-time basis for offered me a 
                full time position. I just turned 18.
                I worked with them for roughly a year, while
                actively seeking other opportunities.
                <br><br> In the December of 2018, I was 
                offered an administrative post, without any hesitation
                I accepted their offer. A week into my new job,
                I stumbled across an advert while listening
                to documentaries. It was about programming courses
                that were offered on the website that was being 
                advertised. I was immediately hooked. 
                I started downloading any material I could find
                online and completed online exercises on the site.
                The job I did was very monotonous and self 
                studying how to code gave me an 
                opportunity to actually apply myself.<br><br>
                Roughly 3 months into my new found hobby.
                A friend told me about Umuzi and I decided to 
                apply. Not long after that they contacted me and
                after successfully completing their bootcamp,
                offered me a learnership. I resigned from
                my job and decided to pursue my hobby.</p>
