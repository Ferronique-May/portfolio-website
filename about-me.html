          <div class="content-text">
            <p>My Name is Ferronique May. I matriculated in 2016. In 2017, I studied a bachelor of Arts in Human 
              Resource and Psychology. After successfully completing my first year, I was forced to postpone
              my studies and work full time. The bookstore I was working on a 
              part-time basis for offered me a full time position and I worked with them for roughly a year, while
              actively seeking other opportunities.<br><br> In the December of 2018, I was 
              offered an administrative post, without any hesitation I accepted their offer. A week into my new job,
              I stumbled across an advert while listening to documentaries. It was about programming courses
              that were offered on the website that was being advertised. I was immediately hooked. 
              I started downloading any material I could find online and completed online exercises on the site.
              The job I did was very monotonous and self studying how to code gave me an 
              opportunity to actually apply myself.<br><br> Roughly 3 months into my new found hobby.
              A friend told me about Umuzi and I decided to apply. Not long after that they contacted me and
              after successfully completing their bootcamp, offered me a learnership. I resigned from
              my job and decided to pursue my hobby.</p>
