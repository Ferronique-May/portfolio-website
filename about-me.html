          <h2 class="content-title">My Story</h2><br><br> 
          <div class="content-text">
            <p> My name is Ferronique May. I was born and raised in Delmore Park. 
                I am the second eldest of four kids. I am very family-oriented and my favourite activity is playing
                30 seconds with them. Everyone is a bit competitive so its always fun. My granny is the reason
                I have such a deep love for music. When I was younger she would play for my cousins
                and myself whenever we slept over. When I was 12, she gave me her keyboard. I still have it,
                its one of my most prided posessions even though its falling apart.
                She got ill shortly after that and never got the chance to actually teach me.
                However I took it upon myself to hopefully one day master the instrument and maybe play for
                my children and grandchildren too.<br><br>
                When I was in High School I developed my love for writing. I was not great by any means but
                with the unconditional support from the best soundboard I have ever had, my oumie, I have managed to improve
                my writing skills. My dream is to one day publish her story its something we always spoke about.<br><br>
                My parents always encourage me to do my best. My father is not a man of many words unless he pulls out 
                the dad jokes. He always says that "you are the only person that stands in your way". Out of all the 
                sayings he has, this is one that really stands out for me. I believe that fear of failure is what
                ultimately drives us to make the decisions that we do. Whenever I doubt myself or an opportunity 
                I go back to those specific words and I use that fear of failing to work harder.<br><br>
                I matriculated in 2016. In 2017, I studied a bachelor of Arts in Human Resource and Psychology. After
                successfully completing my first year, I was forced to postpone my studies and work full time.
                The bookstore I was working on a part-time basis for offered me a full time position. I just turned 18.
                I worked with them for roughly a year, while actively seeking other opportunities.<br><br>
                In the December of 2018, I was offered an administrative post, without any hesitation
                I accepted their offer. A week into my new job, I stumbled across an advert while listening
                to documentaries. It was about programming courses that were offered on the website that was being 
                advertised. I was immediately hooked. I started downloading any material I could find
                online and completed online exercises on the site. The job I did was very monotonous and self 
                studying how to code gave me an opportunity to actually apply myself.<br><br>
                Roughly 3 months into my new found hobby. A friend told me about Umuzi and I decided to 
                apply. Not long after that they contacted me and after successfully completing their bootcamp,
                offered me a learnership. I resigned from my job and decided to pursue my hobby.<br><br>
